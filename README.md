Server.js is running a web server that communicates with both the yelp api and the front-end. Basically Server.js is the messenger without it this app would not be functioning at all.
All of the Front End Code will be found in the src folder.This app uses React for the Front-end and Express for the backend.

##  Instructions
Go into the main directory from there run npm install. After go into the server folder and also run npm install. When everything from npm is intalled you want to start up the server first you started by going into the server directory and typing node server.js. When the server is up and running than go into the main directory and type npm start and that should start up the front end. The ports for the front-end will be 3000 as for the backend it will be 3002.
